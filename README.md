# FirstNodeJsApplication
First experience with node Js (using Express).
to run the app.js fıle 
1-open terminal 
2-write: npm start and enter 
NB:
1-"start" is not a terminal command it is defined in package.Json to facilitate work (rather than wrıtıng each time node app.js)
2-Also i use import instead of require (express) thanks to defining module in package.json.
